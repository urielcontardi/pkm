# Foam

**ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to your new Foam Knowledge Base!**

## Getting started

This documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/macOS/Windows machine.

1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.
2. Press "Use this template" button at [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.
3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.

    *Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item.*

4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)

After setting up the repository, head to [getting started](./getting-started.md) to get familiar with your new knowledge base!

To learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/recipes/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.

And remember that you can always join our [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g)!

## Using Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (Markdown documents) to get you started.

- [inbox](./inbox.md) - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [getting-started](./getting-started.md) - learn how to use your Foam workspace
- [todo](./todo.md) - a place to keep track of things to do

In the `docs` directory you can find everything you need to learn the basics of Foam.

## Submitting Issues

As you may have noticed, issues are disabled. With the goal to keep the project fairly easy to maintain, please file your issues in the main Foam repository:

# Getting Started

Welcome to your new foam workspace, let's get you started.

> if you are already familiar with Foam and don't need help, just remove the `docs` folder for a clean repo.

Let's go through this to set up your repo:

- [ ] if you are new with VS Code, see how to [[get-started-with-vscode]] and how to [[use-keyboard-shortcuts-for-editing]]

- [ ] you can navigate the links between your notes by `cmd+click` (or `ctrl+click` on Windows) on a wikilink. You can go back with `ctrl+-`. Here, go to your [[inbox]]

- [ ] to see how your notes are connected, execute the `Foam: Show Graph` command. See [[graph-visualization]].

- [ ] #tags can be used to further organize your content. Look at the `Tag Explorer` view on the left panel to find and navigate the tags in your knowledge base. See [[tags-and-tag-explorer]].

- [ ] Foam supports [[spell-checking]] via VS Code.

- [ ] You can also paste images in your Foam, just press `cmd+alt+v` to create the image file and link to it from your note. See [[paste-images-from-clipboard]].

- [ ] You can use Foam for your daily notes, or journaling. Execute now the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command to create a new file in your `journal` folder. See [[daily-notes]].

- [ ] Want to see how to manage your tasks? Go to the [[todo]] note

- [ ] The section at the end of this file contains wikilink definitions, which enable navigation of your notes from GitHub's web UI, and in general to make `[[wikilinks]]` understood by any Markdown parser. See [[link-reference-definitions]].

- [ ] To explore all the Foam settings, press `cmd+,`, then `Extensions > Foam`

- [ ] Living within VS Code, Foam can be customized in many ways! Look at the [Foam Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/recipes/recipes) for ideas!

- [ ] Join the [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/e), introduce yourself and leave a message on how you found Foam and how the onboarding went :) We are always keen to do better

- [ ] Take the [Foam Welcome survey](http://foambubble.github.io/welcome-survey/e)! It helps us better understand your need and how we can make Foam better and better for you :)

## Advanced Features

- [ ] You can create [[note-templates]] for things like book reviews, people, daily notes (coming soon), and more!

## About Foam

Foam doesn't do all this magic on its own, it relies on some amazing extensions. Look at their documentation if you want to fully unlock the possibilities!

Here they are:

- [Markdown All In One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- [vscode-paste-image](https://github.com/mushanshitiancai/vscode-paste-image)

A special mention goes to [Markdown Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) and [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) which have now been replaced by our own implementation but were foundational to Foam's beginnings.
